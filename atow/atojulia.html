            The ofiicial description of Julia is " a high level.
            high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical
            computing. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed
            parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive
            mathematical function library. largely written in Julia itself, also
            integrates mature, best-of-breed ioen source C and Fortran Libraries
            for linear algebra, random number generation, sigal processing, and
            dtring processing. In addition, the Julia developer communityt is
            contributing a number of external packages through Julia's built-in
            package manager at rapid pace."

                <li>Julia is quite easy to learn and it has a simple learning curve for people coming from languages like Python, R.</li>
                <li>Julia reaches the speed of compiled languages such as C, C++ and Fortran.</li>
            </ul>

            These two features gives Julia the phrase <b>"Walks like Python, Runs
            like C"</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Another Good Features of Julia Programming Lanuage</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Julia is a multiple dispatch language - In a multiple dispatch
                language, a function call may dispatch to different functions
                depending on the type called run-time, which stands in contrast
                to a single dispatch language, in which a function call always
                sends to the same function. A multiple dispatch environment
                ensures that, depending on the variables provided to the
                function, diffrent results will be produced</li>
            <li>Julia is great for parallelism - The most amazing feature of
                Julia is its parallelism. it can parallelize directly from the
                command line by calling the desired script with a given number
                of cores. Additionally, it is possible to send a tasks to
                different threads directly from code. Lastly, Julia can run
                loops in parallel directly. That is, one does not need to
                designating different threads to each loop.</li>
